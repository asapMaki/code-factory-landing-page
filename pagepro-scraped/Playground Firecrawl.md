## Mobile App Development FAQ

- How much does it cost to build a mobile app?









The price is always a fragile subject, but it shouldn't be. The cost of building mobile applications depends on many factors, but mostly on the level of complexity. Prices may vary from £20K+ for a medium complex mobile app and around £80K+ for a complex one.

The platforms where the app will be released influence the price too, so before starting a software development run market research to discover what mobile devices your target users use and then decide if your need an android app or an iOS app? If the application should run on both a cross platform development would be the most cost-efficient solution.

- How long does it take to build a mobile app?









Here's another common question that has its answer in complexity. Considering two levels, a medium-level complex app can take you around 3+ months, while more complex ones can take more than years.



Just be aware that some extremely ambitious projects can take you years before they will be finally accepted by the users.

- What skills are needed for mobile app developers?









We believe in two kinds of knowledge. The one that you acquire by learning - books, courses, workshops, etc. And the one you can only acquire by constant practice - mastery, interaction, self-confidence, etc.



It's obvious that developers should be great technology-wise, and have great programming knowledge. Yet we also recommend seeking skills that make them great companions and friends, as this is more important and crucial in clear and smooth cooperation.



If it comes to technology and tools, our mobile application developers are comfortable working in React Native, Expo, Redux, TypeScript, Storybook

- How to choose a mobile app development company?









It depends on what kind of commitment level you expect from a mobile app agency. If you have everything you need, except the code, find mobile app developers experienced in a technology you want to use.



If you search for a technology partner, you should choose someone who is able to take over your duties while you are dealing with other important stuff.



Also, you need to feel good while working together. Or in other words, choose a partner for critical moments. The critical moments are always hard to get through, and it's helpful to work with people you like and trust in those moments.

- What are the benefits of cross-platform mobile apps?









Cross-platform apps work everywhere - you don't have to develop two apps (one Android, and one iOS). Instead, you can use one developer (for example React Native) that will build an app ready to be working on both, Android and iOS, and more than that, on every device.



Cross-platform apps are also cost effective - first, you don't have to hire two different mobile app developers for iOS, and Android apps. You have them working on one codebase. More than that, the popularity of web languages is constantly growing, which means it is easier to get a cross-platform developer, and you have many “ready-to-go” solutions that you can use in your own projects.



Cross-platform app development also have a better time to market - building a native app is extremely time-consuming (at least in comparison to cross-platform apps), and by the time you make your native app work, you could be already visible in the market with your MVP and getting the first users, or at least real-life feedback from them.



And it all comes down to the fact that cross-platform apps reach more people - you are able to reach all operating systems users with one app only!
