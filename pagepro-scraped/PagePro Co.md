## Expo Development FAQ

- What is Expo?









Expo is an open-source platform for building cross-platform mobile applications using React Native.



It simplifies the development process by providing a set of tools and services that streamline the app-building experience for iOS, Android, and the web. Expo developers can create native mobile apps using a single codebase, significantly reducing the time and resources needed for app development.



It offers a range of features, such as over-the-air (OTA) updates, the Expo Dev Client to ensure an Expo engineer faster development and debugging on real devices, and EAS Build for easy provisioning and building of ad-hoc builds for internal testing. It also includes a rich ecosystem of pre-built components, libraries, and APIs that help the Expo programmer build feature-rich applications quickly and efficiently.



By leveraging Expo, software developers can focus on writing high-quality JavaScript and React code while the platform handles the complexities of native app development, making it an ideal choice for startups, small businesses, and even large-scale projects.

- How much does it cost to build an Expo app?









The cost of creating an Expo app can vary significantly depending on the project's specific requirements. Here are a few examples to give you an idea:



- A simple mobile app integrated with provided API and based on provided designs starts from £10,000.

- An e-commerce app with multiple integrations, user roles can range from £20,000 to £80,000.

- A social media app with complex features, real-time data updates, and user-generated content might require a budget of £50,000 to £100,000.

- On-demand apps with extensive customizations, advanced features, and multiple integrations can range from £50,000 to £200,000.


At Pagepro, Expo Development Agency, we tailor our services to meet diverse project requirements, ensuring you receive a top-quality mobile application that fits your needs.

- How Expo is different from React Native?









Expo is a framework built on top of React Native that simplifies and accelerates the mobile app development process. While React Native is an open-source framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React, Expo adds an additional layer of tools and services to make the development experience even more seamless and efficient.



Here are some key differences between Expo and React Native:



1. **Easier setup and development:** Expo offers a streamlined setup process, making it easier and faster to start a new project. It comes with a set of pre-configured tools and libraries, reducing the need for manual configuration and allowing developers to focus on writing code.

2. **Managed workflow:** Expo provides a managed workflow, which includes a development environment, build system, and app deployment tools. This allows developers to build, test, and release their apps without dealing with native development environments like Xcode or Android Studio.

3. **Over-the-air (OTA) updates:** Expo supports OTA updates, enabling developers to push updates to their apps without requiring users to download a new version through the App Store or Google Play. This allows for faster iteration and more flexibility in responding to user feedback or fixing bugs.

4. **Expo SDK:** The Expo SDK offers a range of pre-built components and APIs that are not available in vanilla React Native, such as push notifications, camera, and location services. These components simplify the development process and save time by reducing the need to build custom solutions or integrate third-party libraries.

5. **Expo Dev Client:** With the Expo Dev Client, developers can work on their apps using real devices without needing to install Xcode or Android Studio. This enables faster development and debugging while supporting native code.


However, using Expo also has some limitations compared to plain React Native. For example, if a project requires custom native modules or integration with specific native APIs that are not supported by Expo, developers may need to opt for a bare React Native project.

In summary, Expo is a valuable toolset built on top of React Native that simplifies and accelerates mobile app development, making it an ideal choice for software developers who want a more streamlined and efficient development experience.
